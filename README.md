This is my solution of a challenge on a course I started on Udemy.
The challenge is to create a room using composition.
I have decided to accomplish the following:

1. Create a room with a coach, a table and a TV in it.
2. The program checks that if I open the coach as a bed, there is enough room for all objects in the room.

The coach and the TV can not be moved, only the table, which can also be rotated.
